   <h1>Public sharing of research datasets: A pilot study of associations</h1>
   <p>Heather A. Piwowar, Wendy W. Chapman</p>

   <h2>Abstract</h2>
   <p>The public sharing of primary research datasets potentially benefits the research community but is not yet common practice. In this pilot study, we analyzed whether data sharing frequency was associated with funder and publisher requirements, journal impact factor, or investigator experience and impact. Across 397 recent biomedical microarray studies, we found investigators were more likely to publicly share their raw dataset when their study was published in a high-impact journal and when the first or last authors had high levels of career experience and impact. We estimate the USA's National Institutes of Health (NIH) data sharing policy applied to 19% of the studies in our cohort; being subject to the NIH data sharing plan requirement was not found to correlate with increased data sharing behavior in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Studies published in journals that required a database submission accession number as a condition of publication were more likely to share their data, but this trend was not statistically significant. These early results will inform our ongoing larger analysis, and hopefully contribute to the development of more effective data sharing initiatives.</p>

   <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
   <p>Sharing and reusing primary research datasets has the potential to increase research efficiency and quality. Raw data can be used to explore related or new hypotheses, particularly when combined with other available datasets. Real data is indispensable for developing and validating study methods, analysis techniques, and software implementations. The larger scientific community also benefits: sharing data encourages multiple perspectives, helps to identify errors, discourages fraud, is useful for training new researchers, and increases efficient use of funding and population resources by avoiding duplicate data collection.</p>

   <p>Eager to realize these benefits, funders, publishers, societies, and individual research groups have developed tools, resources, and policies to encourage investigators to make their data publicly available. For example, some journals require the submission of detailed biomedical datasets to publicly available databases as a condition of publication (<a href="#35">McCain, 1995</a> and <a href="#43">Piwowar and Chapman, 2008</a>). Many funders require data sharing plans as a condition of funding: since 2003, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the USA has required a data sharing plan for all large funding grants (<a href="#37">NIH, 2003</a>) and has more recently introduced stronger requirements for genome-wide association studies (<a href="#38">NIH, 2007</a>). Several government whitepapers (<a href="#15">Cech, 2003</a> and <a href="#18">Fienberg et al., 1985</a>) and high-profile editorials (<a href="#4">Data's Shameful Neglect, 2009</a>, <a href="#3">Got Data?, 2007</a> and <a href="#2">Time for Leadership, 2007</a>) call for responsible data sharing and reuse. Large-scale collaborative science is increasing the need to share datasets (<a href="#27">Kakazu et al., 2004</a> and <a href="#50">The GAIN Collaborative Research Group, 2007</a>), and many guidelines, tools, standards, and databases are being developed and maintained to facilitate data sharing and reuse (<a href="#48">Schofield et al., 2009</a>, <a href="#6">Barrett et al., 2007</a> and <a href="#11">Brazma et al., 2001</a>).</p>

   <p>Despite these investments of time and money, we do not yet understand the impact of these initiatives. There is a well-known adage: you cannot manage what you do not measure. For those with a goal of promoting responsible data sharing, it would be helpful to evaluate the effectiveness of requirements, recommendations, and tools. When data sharing is voluntary, insights could be gained by learning which datasets are shared, on what topics, by whom, and in what locations. When policies make data sharing mandatory, monitoring is useful to understand compliance and unexpected consequences.</p>

   <p>Dimensions of data sharing action and intension have been investigated by a variety of studies. Manual annotations and systematic data requests have been used to estimate the frequency of data sharing within biomedicine (<a href="#31">Kyzas et al., 2005</a>, <a href="#40">Noor et al., 2006</a>, <a href="#41">Ochsner et al., 2008</a> and <a href="#44">Reidpath and Allotey, 2001</a>), though few attempts were made to determine patterns of sharing and withholding within these samples. <a href="#9">Blumenthal (2006)</a>, <a href="#13">Campbell et al. (2002)</a>, <a href="#21">Hedstrom (2006)</a> and others have used survey results to correlate self-reported instances of data sharing and withholding with self-reported attributes like industry involvement, perceived competitiveness, career productivity, and anticipated data sharing costs. Others have used surveys and interviews to analyze opinions about the effectiveness of mandates (<a href="#54">Ventura, 2005</a>) and the value of various incentives (<a href="#19">Giordano, 2007</a>, <a href="#21">Hedstrom, 2006</a>, <a href="#22">Hedstrom and Niu, 2008</a> and <a href="#39">Niu, 2006</a>). A few inventories list the data sharing policies of funders (<a href="#33">Lowrance, 2006</a> and <a href="#53">University of Nottingham, 2009</a>) and journals (<a href="#12">Brown, 2003</a> and <a href="#35">McCain, 1995</a>), and some work has been done to correlate policy strength with outcome (<a href="#36">McCullough et al., 2008</a> and <a href="#43">Piwowar and Chapman, 2008</a>). Surveys and case studies have been used to develop models of information behavior in related domains, including knowledge sharing within an organization (<a href="#17">Constant et al., 1994</a> and <a href="#34">Matzler et al., 2008</a>), physician knowledge sharing in hospitals (<a href="#46">Ryu, Ho, & Han, 2003</a>), participation in open source projects (<a href="#7">Bitzer, Schrettl, & Schröder, 2007</a>), academic contributions to institutional archives (<a href="#28">Kim, 2007</a> and <a href="#47">Seonghee and Boryung, 2008</a>), the choice to publish in open access journals (<a href="#55">Warlick & Vaughan, 2007</a>), sharing social science datasets (<a href="#21">Hedstrom, 2006</a>), and participation in large-scale biomedical research collaborations (<a href="#32">Lee et al., 2006</a>).</p>

   <p>Although these studies provide valuable insights and their methods facilitate investigation into an author's intentions and opinions, they have several limitations. First, associations between an investigator's intention to share data do not directly translate to an association with actually sharing data (<a href="#30">Kuo & Young, 2008</a>). Second, associations that rely on self-reported data sharing and withholding likely suffer from underreporting and confounding, since people admit withholding data much less frequently than they report having experienced the data withholding of others (<a href="#9">Blumenthal et al., 2006</a>).</p>

   <p>We suggest a supplemental approach for investigating research data sharing behavior. As part of an ongoing doctoral dissertation project, we are collecting and analyzing a large set of observed data sharing actions and associated policy, investigator, and environmental variables. In this report we provide preliminary findings on a small collection of studies and a few key questions: Are studies led by experienced and prolific primary investigators more likely to share their data than those led by junior investigators? Do funder and publisher requirements for data sharing increase the frequency with which data is shared? Are other funder and publisher characteristics associated with data sharing frequency?</p>

   <p>We choose to study data sharing for one particular type of data: biological gene expression microarray intensity values. Microarray studies provide a useful environment for exploring data sharing policies and behaviors. Despite being a rich resource valuable for reuse (<a href="#45">Rhodes et al., 2004</a>), microarray data are often but not yet universally shared. Best-practice guidelines for sharing microarray data are fairly mature (<a href="#11">Brazma et al., 2001</a> and <a href="#25">Hrynaszkiewicz and Altman, 2009</a>). Two centralized databases have emerged as best-practice repositories: the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (<a href="#6">Barrett et al., 2007</a>) and ArrayExpress (<a href="#42">Parkinson et al., 2007</a>). Finally, high-profile letters have called for strong journal data sharing policies (<a href="#5">Ball et al., 2004</a>), resulting in unusually strong data sharing requirements in some journals (<a href="#1">Microarray Standards at Last, 2002</a>).</p>

   <h2>2. Methods</h2>
   <p>We identified a set of studies in which the investigators had generated gene expression microarray datasets, and which of these had made their datasets publicly available on the Internet. We analyzed variables related to the investigators, journals, and funding of these studies to determine which attributes were associated an increased frequency of data sharing.</p>

   <h3>2.1. Studies for analysis</h3>
   <p><a href="#41">Ochsner et al. (2008)</a> manually reviewed articles in 20 journals to identify studies in which the authors generated microarray data. They found 397 such studies. Ochsner and co-investigators then searched online databases and web pages to determine which of these studies had made their gene expression profile datasets publicly available on the Internet. </p>

   <p>We use the Ochsner dataset as the article cohort, and their identification of data sharing as our dependent variable. In addition, we collected additional covariates to use as independent variables, as described below.</p>

   <h3>2.2. Author impact and experience</h3>
   <p>For each study, we collected variables related to the number of authors and the address of the corresponding author from PubMed® metadata.</p>

   <p>We also characterized “author experience” of each first and last author (customarily the most hands-on and senior investigators, respectively, of a biomedical study) through a combination of their h-index (<a href="#23">Hirsch, 2005</a>), a-index (<a href="#26">Jin, 2006</a>), and number of years since publishing their first paper. We chose h-index and a-index since recent research suggests they represent different aspects of an investigator's research productivity and impact (<a href="#10">Bornmann, Mutz, & Daniel, 2008</a>). We estimated these indices using data from PubMed, PubMed Central®, and the Author-ity name disambiguation engine (<a href="#51">Torvik and Smalheiser, 2009</a> and <a href="#52">Torvik et al., 2005</a>) to derive what we call an author's “pubmedi” h-index and a-index.</p>

   <p>Briefly, for each first and last author, we submitted the author's name and known publication PubMed ID to the 2008 Author-ity web service (<a href="http://128.248.65.210/arrowsmith_uic/author2.html">http://128.248.65.210/arrowsmith_uic/author2.html</a>). Author-ity returned a list of publications estimated to be authored by the given investigator. For each of the PubMed publications in the Author-ity results list, we queried PubMed Central for the list of PubMed Central articles that cite the given PubMed publication, using the eUtils web service interface at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/eutils_help.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/eutils_help.html</a>. Finally, we used the list of {PubMed ID, Number of times the PubMed ID was cited by an article in PubMed Central} pairs to compute the pubmedi h-index and a-index surrogates for the author.</p>

   <p>We also estimated the number of years since each author published his or her first paper (as indexed by PubMed) as a proxy for author age and/or career experience. We calculated this duration by extracting the earliest publication year from each author's Author-ity publication list.</p>

   <p>To conserve degrees of freedom in this pilot study, we clustered the pubmedi h-index, a-index and career length into one variable through principal component analysis. We call the first principal component coefficient of these variables (the log transform of h-index and a-index, and career length as number of years between the publication of first paper and 2008) the “author experience” in subsequent analysis. The author experience metric for first authors and last authors were computed separately. Each has a mean of 0.0 and a 25th and 75th percentile at approximately −1.0 and +1.0, respectively.</p>

   <h3>2.3. Grant funding and mandates</h3>

   <p>For this pilot study, we focused on funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the major government biomedical funding body in the United States. For studies funded by the NIH, we collected the history of applicable grants, the total amount of funding per fiscal year, and we attempted to estimate whether the grant was subject to the NIH's data sharing plan requirements. A data sharing plan is a required component of all proposals submitted to the NIH after 2003 that request more than $500 000 (United States dollars) in direct funding per year. Total grant funding from the NIH usually consists of direct funding (that which is specifically applicable to the proposal, such as investigator salaries and research supplies) and indirect funding (general facilities and administrative overhead, such as building depreciation and maintenance costs). The relative amounts of direct and indirect funding in a grant vary per institution.</p>

   <p>We determined which studies were funded by the NIH using PubMed metadata. For studies with NIH grants, we looked up each of the NIH grant numbers in the NIH grant database (<a href="http://report.nih.gov/award/state/state.cfm">http://report.nih.gov/award/state/state.cfm</a>). From this information we tabulated the amount of total funding received for each of the fiscal years 2003–2007. We assumed that those with more than $750 000 in total funding in any given year had received at least $500 000 in direct funding. We also estimated the date of renewal by identifying the most recent year in which the grant number was prefixed by a “1” or “2” -- indication that the grant is “new” or “renewed.” Finally, we assumed that any grant with more than $750 000 in total funds in a single year and with a new or renewed grant since 2003 was subject to the NIH data sharing plan requirement.</p>

   <p>For studies identified in PubMed as funded by the NIH but without a complete NIH grant number listed in the PubMed metadata, we imputed the sum of the maximum award amount and whether the NIH data sharing requirement would have applied based on all other available variables using a multivariate tree classification as performed by <a href="#20">Herrell (2001)</a>.</p>

   <h3>2.4. Journal impact and mandates</h3>

   <p>For each study, we collected two variables related to the journal in which it was published: impact factor, and the strength of the journal's policy on data sharing. We gathered the impact factor for each of the 20 journals from ISI Journal Citation Reports 2007. We identified the strength of a journal's data sharing policy by inspecting its “Instruction to Author” statement. As in <a href="#43">Piwowar & Chapman (2008)</a>, we grouped journals with no mention of data sharing applicable to microarrays as “no mention”, a request or unenforceable requirement as a “weak policy,” and those that required an accession number from submission to an online database as a “strong policy.”</p>

   <h3>2.5. Statistical methods</h3>

   <p>We used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the association between authorship, grant, and journal attributes of a study and the public availability of its microarray data. Statistical analysis was performed using the Hmisc and Design packages for regression and visualization (<a href="http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/Hmisc">http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/Hmisc</a>) in R version 2.7 (<a href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</a>). P-Values are two-tailed.</p>

   <h3>2.6. Data and code availability</h3>

   <p>Statistical scripts and the raw dataset are included as supplemental data and are also available at http://www.researchremix.org.</p>

   <h2>3. Results</h2>

   <p>We studied the data sharing patterns of 397 gene expression microarray studied published in 2007 within 20 journals, as identified in a systematic review by Ochsner et al. (2008). Almost half of the studies made their raw datasets available (47%).</p>

   <p>We found that 41 of the articles acknowledged NIH funding but did not reveal specific grant numbers; these studies appear to be randomly distributed throughout the sample, so we estimated their levels of NIH funding from other attributes, as described in Section 2.</p>

   <p>As seen in <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a4/a4-1.jpg">Fig. 1</a> , in univariate analysis many variables were found to vary with prevalence of data sharing: the impact factor of the journal, the strength of the journal's data sharing policy, the number of authors, the h-index and a-index of the first and last author, the career length of the first author, whether the corresponding author had a US-based address, and whether the study was funded by more than $2 million dollars of NIH grants.</p>

   <p>We estimated that the NIH data sharing policy applied to 61 of the studies (the study was submitted to the NIH after 2003 and received more than $500 000 in direct NIH funding per year): these 61 studies had a slightly higher frequency of data sharing in univariate analysis (52% vs. 46%). Last author career length and whether or not they received any NIH funding appeared to be largely independent of data sharing frequency.</p>

   <p>The results of multivariate analysis are shown in <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a4/a4-2.jpg">Table 1</a>. The impact factor of the journal and the experience component for the first and the last authors were significantly associated with an increase in data sharing prevalence, with corresponding author country and journal policy strength is trending towards but not reaching statistical significance.</p>

   <p>The size of these effects are illustrated in <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a4/a4-3.jpg">Fig. 2</a>: a study with a corresponding address in the USA was twice as likely to publicly share its microarray data; a study published in a journal with an impact factor of 15 was 4.5 times as likely to have shared data compared to a study published in a journal with an impact factor of 5 (assuming all other covariates are held constant), increased author experience suggests a increased odds of data sharing, and the odds of data sharing is higher in journals with a weak data sharing policy than in a journal with no data sharing policy, and higher yet in journals with a strong data sharing policy.</p>

   <p>We display stratified relationships in <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a4/a4-4.jpg">Fig. 3</a>, <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a4/a4-5.jpg">Fig. 4</a> and <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a4/a4-6.jpg">Fig. 5</a> to explore interactions for future studies. For example, in Fig. 3a we can see that first authors with a “high” level of experience are more likely to share data across the full range of impact factors, while Fig. 3b suggests that last authors with a “low” level of experience are less likely to share data.</p>

   <p><a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a4/a4-5.jpg">Fig. 4</a> illustrates interactions with journal policy strength. As seen in Fig. 4a, impact factor is very strongly associated with journal policy strength. Fig. 4b and c suggests that Strong journal policies are associated with an increased frequency of data sharing for all levels of first and last author experience, for a given journal impact factor.</p>

   <p>Finally, <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a4/a4-6.jpg">Fig. 5</a> shows the weak association between NIH policy and data sharing. There does not appear to be a systematic trend with impact factor, though there is faint evidence that authors are more likely to respond to an NIH data sharing policy as they become more “experienced” (as the first principal component of their h-index, a-index, and number of years since first publication increases).</p>


   <h2>4. Discussion</h2>
   <p>This study explored the association between policy variables, author experience, selected article attributes, and frequency of data sharing within 397 recent gene expression microarray studies. We found that data sharing was more prevalent for studies published in journals with a higher impact factor and by authors with more experience. Whether or not the study was funded by the NIH had little impact on data sharing rates. We estimate the NIH data sharing policy applied to only 19% of the studies, and was not correlated with an increase in data sharing in multivariate analysis. Articles published in journals with a strong data sharing requirement were more likely to share their data, but this trend was not statistically significant in this pilot study.</p>

   <p>We note that the associations we have identified do not imply causation. It is possible, for example, that publishing in a high-impact journal and deciding to share data are not causally related but rather both a result of a high level of funding that facilitates impactful research and resources for sharing data.</p>

   <p>The data collection and analysis methods used in this pilot study confer additional limitations. Several of our independent variables were highly correlated with one another: future work should cluster correlated variables together to improve robustness of the association estimates. Assumptions about proportions of direct and indirect funding costs may have been incorrect, leading to over- or underestimations of the applicability of NIH mandates. Our focus on measured variables, and particularly the narrow scope of the pilot study, suggest that the given analysis omits many important associations with data sharing. Consequently, our results may suffer from Simpson's paradox (<a href="#49">Simpson, 1951</a>) in which the consideration of additional variables reveals contradictory association patterns.</p>

   <p>The results of this pilot study may not be generally applicable. Because articles in this study were drawn from 20 relatively high-impact journals, the results may not accurately characterize data sharing behavior of studies published in low impact journals. It is not known to what degree the data sharing behavior we discovered would generalize to other data types. This pilot study does not consider directed sharing, such as peer-to-peer data exchange or sharing within a defined collaboration network, and thus underestimates the amount of data sharing in all its forms. We only looked at funder policies for the NIH: adherence to the policies of other funders may be different.</p>

   <p>It was surprising how seldom the NIH data sharing plan applied to the studies in our cohort, by our estimation. The NIH data sharing requirement stipulates that all proposal submitted to the NIH after October 2003 and requesting more than $500 000 in direct costs per fiscal year must submit a data sharing plan. We did not have access to data that explicitly stated which grants required the submission of a data sharing plan, so we attempted to infer the information based on the grant numbers listed in the study articles and the NIH grants database. Most NIH grants listed in our cohort had been renewed since 2003 (141 of 187 studies for which we had NIH grant information), but only about half of these received more than $750 000 in total costs during any fiscal year (our approximation to $500k in direct costs). Our conclusions about the NIH data sharing policy should be considered preliminary, given this relatively small number of applicable studies included in our current dataset.</p>

   <p>The strength of a journal's data sharing policy was not significantly correlated with data sharing frequency. We believe the trend found by this pilot study would likely strengthen when we widen our dataset to include a larger selection of journals, as found by <a href="#43">Piwowar & Chapman (2008)</a>. We note that for the most strict journal policies, those that require an accession number for publication, the data sharing frequency is only 51%. Clearly publishers do not enforce their policies very rigorously, especially in lower-impact journals.</p>

   <p>Our “author experience” proxy variable was associated with data sharing frequency for both the first and last author (in biomedicine, customarily, the first and last authors make the largest contributions to a study and have the most power in publication decisions). We plan to investigate this finding in greater detail in future work, to isolate whether the correlation between data sharing behavior and “experience” has more to do with author age, tenure status, previous experience in the field, or previous experience sharing data. Although we used h-index and a-index citation metrics in this preliminary investigation, correlation with other citation index variants may be more appropriate for our model and will be explored in future research.</p>

   <p>We intend to refine the preliminary work presented here through the collection and analysis of additional data points and variables. We hope that by using text analysis we can automatically identify many more studies that generate gene expression microarray data than the 397 in this sample, and thus investigate additional publication years and journals. Using this expanded set, we plan to analyze several additional variables. Previous work (<a href="#8">Blumenthal et al., 1997</a>) found that investigator gender was correlated with data withholding. Given that male scientists are more likely than women to have large NIH grants (<a href="#24">Hosek et al., 2005</a>), it is possible that gender is confounding our findings. We hope to estimate investigator gender using first names, perhaps using a web-context tool (<a href="http://www.gpeters.com/names/baby-names.php">http://www.gpeters.com/names/baby-names.php</a>). Also, investigators who have submitted data before may be more likely to do so again. We will investigate this effect by including variables about whether the first or last authors have previously shared microarray datasets. We also hope to explore whether the authors have previously published in open access journals; the size, type, and research orientation of the corresponding author's institution; and the disease and organism focus of the study.</p>

   <p>Although the current work is too preliminary for actionable conclusions, it is instructive to speculate about what observations about policy impact could be drawn in the future, should these results be confirmed. First, it appears that the NIH data sharing policy only applies to minority of the NIH funded studies that generate gene expression microarray data. Second, studies that are required to submit a data sharing plan as a condition of NIH funding seem no more likely to share data than other similar studies. Third, policies that require database submission accession numbers are more effective than those that request or require submission in a non-enforceable manner.</p>

   <p>These conclusions would have several policy implications for increasing the effectiveness of data sharing policies. The first suggestion is an expansion of the NIH data sharing policy inclusion criteria, either by lowering the funding amount to which the rules apply or making them applicable to all grants upon a certain milestone, such as publication. The second suggestion is to make policies more enforceable. Whenever there is a requirement for data sharing by a journal or a funder, require that the investigators cite the database submission accession number in their publication or future grant submission correspondence, in similar treatment to the current PubMed Central open-access accession number. Third, we suggest considering the approaches by which high-impact journals achieve such high rates of data sharing compliance: their combination of strict policies, active oversight, and visibility are likely related to the impressive 94% data sharing rate we found for studies published in journals with an impact factor above 15.</p>

   <h2>5. Conclusions</h2>

   <p>We believe our emphasis on observed variables facilitates measurement of important quantitative associations. Data sharing policies are controversial (<a href="#14">Campbell, 1999</a>, <a href="#16">Cecil and Boruch, 1988</a> and <a href="#29">King, 1995</a>), and thus deserve to be thoughtfully considered and evaluated. We hope the results from our analyses will contribute to a deeper understanding of information behavior for research data sharing, and eventually more effective data sharing initiatives so that the value of research related output can be most fully realized.</p>
